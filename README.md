A Simple File Cloner

At the moment program can only copy text files (synchronously), and copies all files to the ROOT of the given Output folder (instead of creating the specific directories it came from).

Created for a few reasons: 

- Git commands skills
- Simple program to keep me busy
- Get more experience with styling of controls
- To see how advanced I can make it in the future
